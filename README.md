# Personal chatbot
I have created a simple chatbot. The chatbot can take a simple reminder request (e.g., "remind me to drink water") and echo back the reminder.


It will answer only this questions:
Example Conversation:
Hello! I'm your personal chatbot. How can I assist you today?

You: hi
Chatbot: Hi there! How can I help you?

You: what's your name?
Chatbot: My name is Chatbot. What's your name?

You: my name is John
Chatbot: Nice to meet you, John!

You: remind me to call mom
Chatbot: Sure! I'll remind you to call mom.

You: what's the time?
Chatbot: The current time is 14:34:22.

You: bye
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
